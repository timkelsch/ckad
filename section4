Design Patterns:
- Sidecar: Log agent along side web server
- Adapter: Processes logs from many apps to normalize to single format before sending.
- Ambassador: Connects to one of three DBs based on the environment

Init Containers:
They start when the pod starts, run to completion, and die. each init container is run one at a time in sequential order.
- Pulls data from a repo
- Waits for external dependencies to be up
