HELM

Basically a package manager for K8S
Has a release manager
Let's us treat our thing as an app instead of a collection of objects.

helm install app
helm upgrade app
helm rollback app
helm uninstall app

Helm Install Prereqs:
K8S installed
Kubectl installed

Helm Install:
sudo snap install helm --classic
apt - copy from docs


CONCEPTS

Steps:
1. Convert any variables in your K8S object files to template style: {{ .Values.variable }}
2. Define those variables in the values.yml file
3. Use your own chart of use an existing one at artifacthub.io
   - helm search hub search_term
4. Create another repo:
   - helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
5. Search it: helm search repo search_term (makes no sense)
6. List repos: helm repo list

To install an app:
helm install release_name chart_name

Releases are independent of each other

List installed packages:
helm list

Download but not install:
helm pull --untar bitnami/wordpress

Install drupal from bitnami:
